# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
## Define Software Engineering:

`What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?`
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems while traditional programming focuses on wring code to solve specific problems.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

`Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.`
SDLC is a structured process that is used in software engineering to design, develop and test good quality software through various phases.
#### Phases
1. Requirements - The team defines project goals, identifies the target audience and gather user requirements.
2. Design - Based on the requirements, the system engineers design the overall architecture of the software, system components, how they will interact and the technologies to be used.
3. Implementation - In this phase, programmers write the code using programming languages and tools to build the functionalities outlined in the design phase.
4. Testing - In this phase, testing of the developed software is carried out to identify and fix bugs before the software is taken to production.
5. Deployment - After testing is carried out and everything validated, the software product is taken to the production environment and the end users can use it.
6. Maintenance - This stage involves fixing bugs reported by users after deployment, adding new features and keeping the software

## Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

`Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?`
Agile is flexible and adaptable to change, allowing teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and incorporation of new ideas while waterfall is a linear, sequential approach, where each phase be completed before moving on to the next phase.

## Requirements Engineering:

`What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.`
It is the process of gathering, analyzing, specifying, and managing the requirements for a system to ensure that the final product meets the user and shareholders requirements.

### Software Design Principles:

`Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?`
Modularity breaks down software into independent, reusable components for easier maintenance and future growth. It improves maintability by allowing easy fixing of bugs and errors since the software is broken down to isolate components. It also enables easy maintability by making it easy to collaborate with others.
Scalability is improved in modularity as it's easy to allow the system to grow depending on the workload. For instance in a web servers, load balancers can add or reduce resources based on traffic the web site is receiving.

### Testing in Software Engineering:

`Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?`
1. Unit Testing - Tests individual modules of a system to validade it's functionalities.
2. Integration Testing - Tests intergrations bwtween different modules of a system to ensure they are working as expected.
3. System Testing - Tests the all system comprising of all modules to ensure that it meets the functional and non-functional requirements.
4.Acceptance Testing  - This is carried out by the end-users to validate that their business requirements where meet and it's carried
against the user requirements collected at the requirements stage of the SDLC.

### Version Control Systems:

`What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.`
This are tools used in software development to keep track of changes made to source code and files. They are important in that they enable to keep track of changed made to software code, allow collaboration between team members and acts as a dister recovery plan as you can revert to previous versions of code.
Popular VCSs include `Git`,`Github`,`Bitbucket`,`GitLab`.

### Software Project Management:

`Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?`
Project manager is responsible for planning, executing and delivering software projects. His/her key responsibilities include:
1. Define project scope.
2. Creating schedules to ensure projects are met in specified timelines.
3. Allocating resources ensuring budgets are meet.
4. Mitigating risks to ensure project meets its objectives.
5. Monitoring and reporting to various teams i.e developers, stakeholders.

Challanges:
1. Managing stakeholders expections and adressing scope changes.
2. Handling project changes i.e last minute change of user requirements.
3. Ensuring team collaborations especially in an environment where team members work remotely.
4. Dealing with resource contraints like limited budget, time and having unskilled personnel.
5. Identifying and mitigating projects risks to prevent delays and failures.

### Software Maintenance:

`Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?`
It is the process of modifying, updating, and enhancing software applications after its' deployment.
It is essential as in makes sure that software remains efficient, effective and adapts to changing business requirements.
There are different types of maintenance e.g:
1. Infrastructure maintenance which ensure software can run in changed environments i.e. change in OS, hardware upgrade.
2. Adaptive maintence to ensure that software meets regulations like the new kenya data protection act - 2019.
2. Bug maintentance to fix bugs and errors on the software.

### Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

`What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?`
Software developers may face ethical challenges relating to data privacy on collection of personal data, security threats that may lead to software breaches and hacking leading to loss of user information, use of intellectual property against owner's copyright leading to infrignment, some software use more enerngy and electricity leading environmental effect. To meet ethical standards, they should prioritize user privacy, security measures, intellectual property rights, environmental sustainability, and assessing the potential societal implications of software products. This includes ongoing education, incorporating ethics into the design process, working with a diverse range of stakeholders, performing ethical reviews, fostering transparency and responsibility, and constantly reflecting on and improving ethical practices.

## Submission Guidelines:
